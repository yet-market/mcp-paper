## 🧪 **EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN**

### **Test Case: Luxembourg SARL Creation Process**

**Why This Case Study:**
- ✅ **Complex multi-step legal process** requiring multiple documents
- ✅ **Clear success criteria** (complete, accurate business formation guidance)
- ✅ **Real business need** (entrepreneurs actually use this)
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes** (completeness, accuracy, usability)
- ✅ **Foundation-dependent** (requires 1915 Commercial Law, 2002 Registry Law, etc.)

### **Three Architecture Approaches:**

#### **Approach A: Traditional Sequential (Baseline)**
- **8-phase workflow** with 6 separate MCP tools
- **Sequential execution**: search → citations → relationships → amendments → content → status
- **Manual orchestration** by AI client
- **No foundation intelligence**

#### **Approach B: Foundation Discovery (Proposed)**
- **4-phase workflow** with 1 super tool + 6 backup tools
- **Intelligent foundation discovery**: 6 proven SPARQL methods with ranking
- **Automatic orchestration** within super tool
- **Foundation-first methodology**

#### **Approach C: Monolithic (Comparison)**
- **Single comprehensive tool** handling entire SARL creation process
- **All functionality embedded** in one MCP tool
- **No decomposition** or modularity

### **Evaluation Scenarios:**

1. **Standard SARL Creation** (typical single-owner business)
2. **SARL with Foreign Investors** (additional complexity)
3. **SARL in Regulated Sectors** (financial services requirements)
4. **Edge Cases** (missing information, unusual structures)
5. **Error Recovery** (tool failures, network issues)

## 📊 **EVALUATION METRICS**

### **Primary Metrics:**

1. **⚡ Processing Time** (seconds to complete query)
2. **💰 Cost per Query** (USD including API calls)
3. **🎯 Accuracy Score** (correctness of legal information)
4. **🏛️ Foundation Discovery Rate** (% of relevant foundation laws found)
5. **❌ Hallucination Rate** (% of fake URIs/content generated)

### **Secondary Metrics:**

1. **📋 Completeness Score** (% of required information provided)
2. **🔗 Citation Quality** (valid legal references per response)
3. **⚖️ Legal Hierarchy Compliance** (respects foundation → implementation → execution order)
4. **🛠️ Error Recovery Rate** (successful handling of failures)
5. **📈 User Satisfaction** (usability with legal professionals)

### **Detailed Measurement Framework:**

#### **Accuracy Assessment:**
- **Legal Information Correctness** (verified against official sources)
- **Procedural Step Accuracy** (validated with legal experts)
- **Citation Verification** (all URIs checked for validity)
- **Requirement Completeness** (all mandatory steps included)

#### **Foundation Discovery Evaluation:**

- **Legal Hierarchy Mapping** (LOI → RGD → AMIN structure respected)
- **Citation Network Analysis** (foundation interconnections discovered)
- **Amendment Tracking** (current vs historical versions)

#### **Hallucination Detection:**
- **URI Validity Check** (all legal document URIs verified)
- **Content Verification** (titles/descriptions match actual documents)
- **Legal Authority Validation** (issuing authorities exist and are correct)
- **Date Consistency** (temporal information accurate)
