## 🚀 Phase 2: Tool Optimization & Enhancement

### **🔧 P1: Tool Usage Optimization**
**Priority: High | Effort: Low | Timeline: 1 week**

**Issue:** Currently using 6/7 available tools consistently
- Sometimes missing `get_relationships()` in research workflow
- Occasionally analyzing fewer documents than optimal

**Solution:**
- Enhance system prompt to mandate ALL 6 tools usage
- Force multi-document analysis (minimum 2 primary laws)
- Add tool usage validation in client

**Expected Impact:** 100% tool utilization, more comprehensive legal analysis

### **🔄 P1.1: Iteration Strategy Investigation**
**Priority: Medium | Effort: Medium | Timeline: 2 weeks**

**Research Question:** How does iteration limit affect legal research depth?
- AI is NOT aware of iteration count or limits
- Current: 20 max iterations, typically uses 7-8
- Investigation: Does higher limit (50+) lead to deeper research?

**Research Plan:**
- Test various iteration limits (20, 50, 100)
- Measure research depth vs iteration count
- Analyze tool usage patterns with different limits
- Determine optimal iteration strategy for legal research

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Optimal iteration limit for comprehensive legal analysis
- Understanding of AI research behavior patterns
- Potential for iteration-aware prompting strategies

### **🌐 P2: Multilingual Intelligence System**
**Priority: High | Effort: Medium | Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

**Requirement:** Intelligent language handling strategy
- **Search Strategy:** Always search in French (Luxembourg legal language)
- **Response Language:** Match user's question language automatically
- **Support Languages:** French, English, German, Luxembourgish

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Language Detection:** Auto-detect user question language

- German question → French search → German legal analysis  
- Luxembourgish question → French search → Luxembourgish legal analysis

**Technical Requirements:**
- Language detection library integration
- Legal terminology translation dictionaries
- Bilingual/multilingual legal concept mapping

**Expected Impact:** 
- Accessible to all Luxembourg language communities
- Maintains legal accuracy through French search consistency
- Expands user base significantly
